The "issue" of the program's outputted Koaloader DLLs being detected as false positives such as Mamson.A!ac, Phonzy.A!ml, Wacatac.H!ml, Malgent!MSR, and/or potentially others has already been posted and explained over 10 times now... please do not post it again; instead, refer to the explanations within [issue #40](https://github.com/pointfeev/CreamInstaller/issues/40) and its linked issues.
