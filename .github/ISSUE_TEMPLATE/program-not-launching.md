First and foremost, note that the program currently only supports Windows 8+ 64-bit machines, as .NET 7+ no longer support Windows 7. If that does not apply to you, then make sure you've extracted the executable from the ZIP file before you've launched it, resolved your antivirus, and have tried downloading the .NET Desktop Runtime mentioned under installation instructions. If none of the above work, then I simply cannot do anything about it, and either your system is not supported by .NET 7 or something is wrong/corrupted with your system.
